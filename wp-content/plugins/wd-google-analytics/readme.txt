= Privacy Notices =

Google Analytics by 10Web plugin adds GA JS code to the site (optionally) and is used to get GA reports from admin area. It sends analytics data to Google. Whether it will send any personal data to Google, depends on how you set up your website. For example, do not expose emails or other personally identifiable information to Google via URLs. Do not send form submissions via analytics to Google.  By default, all the IPs of visitors are anonymized. Personal data processing by Google is explained in their privacy policy https://policies.google.com/privacy. The plugin retrieves from Google and caches data of your GA account and analytics reports in WordPress site database to provide optimization. Reports data is stored in DB for some small period of time (less than 24h). Your GA account data is preserved in your website database as long as you decide to keep it. The plugin asks for your consent to collect site administrator’s email address and site URL to offer customer support, deals and discounts on premium products and more.
